# Readme

This is a collection of c++ programs to compute the distance between primary clusters (see ref..). 

The main computation is perfomed by the program dist_Icl.c

## Requirements
g++ 7 or higher

## Installation
Installation consists in compiling the programs bu using the Makefiles.
Use "make" in the root folder to compile dist_Icl.c
Use "make aux" in the root folder to compile auxiliary programs.


## Input data



### TODO
- Include normalization (clI sizes needed, but they are easy to compute)
